# BUP

In this video, we use Unreal Engine to build a digital twin environment and Convai to create digital humans, showcasing what we believe to be the BUP framework. Although it is quite basic and the functionality is very rudimentary, we aim to present the potential of large language models and agent-based modeling in a visual way.
